# Portfolio Site
## Overview

This is a simple portfolio website created as part of CSCI 713: Software Development Processes. The purpose of this project is to practice applying development processes to a small, incremental project. The site will serve as a basic personal portfolio, with room for future customization.

##Project Goals

* Establish a bare-bones structure for a portfolio site.

* Follow a process-oriented approach to development using GitHub issues.

* Demonstrate iterative progress through small, trackable tasks.

## Tech Stack

* HTML for structure

* CSS for styling (initially minimal, expand later)

* JavaScript for interactivity if needed in future iterations
